These files are the same as those available from, with the WebKit browser libraries removed
due to (default, non-LFS) GitHub:

https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/

These files are included here to make it easier to just clone off this repository and
immediately run the project.

The JavaFX web libraries - the embedded WebKit browser components, are NOT included 
due to GitHub template size restrictions. You can download those from the link above 
and drop them into your own GitHub repo and they should work fine.
