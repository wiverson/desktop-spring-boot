These files are the same as those available from:

https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/

...included here to make it easier to just clone off this repository and immediately
run the project.

Please note that the JavaFX web libraries - the embedded WebKit browser components,
are NOT included due to GitHub template size restrictions. You can download those
from the link above and drop them into your own GitHub repo and they should work
fine.
